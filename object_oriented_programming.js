/* OOP helps us to achieve the following...

Abstraction: 
    hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency

Encapsulation: 
    is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit

Inheritance: 
    Enables new objects to receive or inherit the properties and methods of existing objects

Polymorphism: 
    Allows for many forms of the same type of object through inheritance
    
OOP becomes very important as our front-end code grows in complexity. 
Even a simple app will have lots of code on the front-end to do things like...

    Send requests to a back-end to fetch / update / destroy data
    Update the state of the page as data changes
    Respond to events like clicking buttons
